# Tool-Steganography
Steganography is hiding a file or a message inside of another file , there are many fun steganography CTF challenges out there where the flag is hidden in an image , audio file or even other types of files. Here is a list of the most tools I use and some other useful resources.
## Exiftool
Sometimes important stuff is hidden in the metadata of the image or the file , exiftool can be very helpful to view the metadata of the files.
<p>Useful commands:
<br><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">exiftool file</code> : shows the metadata of the given file</p>
